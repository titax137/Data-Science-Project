# Online Retail Analysis
Welcome to the Online Retail Analysis project! In this project, i will be analyzing the "Online Retail" dataset, which contains information about transactions made by customers of an online retail company. The goal of this project is to identify any data anomalies in the dataset, as well as gain insights into customer behavior and product performance.

pandas
seaborn (optional, for data visualization)
You can install these libraries using pip:
