# Online Retail Analysis
Welcome to the Online Retail Analysis project! In this project, i will be analyzing the "Online Retail" dataset, which contains information about transactions made by customers of an online retail company. The goal of this project is to identify any data anomalies in the dataset, as well as gain insights into customer behavior and product performance.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code in this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
seaborn (optional, for data visualization)
You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas seaborn
```

To run the code in this project, simply execute the following command:

```
python analyze_online_retail.ipynb
```
This will run the analyze_online_retail.py script, which will perform the data anomaly and business insight analysis on the "Online Retail" dataset.

Results
The results of the analysis will be printed to the console and, if seaborn is installed, visualized in a series of plots. The output will include any identified data anomalies, as well as insights into customer behavior and product performance.

I hope you find this project useful and informative! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
